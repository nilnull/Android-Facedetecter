# Ace Test
Using 100% Open Source technologies, make a mobile app to take a picture, upload the
picture onto a cloud Computer Vision library to detect the number of human faces inside the
picture. Send response back to the mobile app with the number. Canbuild on Android, iOS,
can use React Native, Swift, Objective C++, Java, embedded web HTML5 or any other
framework


## 📱 About the app
The app contains various examples of ML-Kit (Vision part), each example is presented as a single activity (All in one app 🤭)

## 💫 Available Examples

### 📸 Camera
- [📷 CameraX example](app/src/main/java/com/asmaamir/mlkitdemo/CameraX): Preview, Capture and Analyze functionalities 🤹‍♀️ 

### 💼 ML Kit Models
- [👩‍🚀 Real time face detection](app/src/main/java/com/asmaamir/mlkitdemo/RealTimeFaceDetection): Contour detecting 
- [🎴 Face detection from a picked image](app/src/main/java/com/asmaamir/mlkitdemo/CaptureFaceDetection): Contour, landmarks and face classification
- [🕵️‍♀️ Face detection and tracking](app/src/main/java/com/asmaamir/mlkitdemo/FaceTracking): Tracking faces over frames
- [🌞 Real time object detection](app/src/main/java/com/asmaamir/mlkitdemo/RealTimeObjectDetection): Object detection and classification


## Note
-  Presented codes are not optimized, since it is a demo it aims **simplicity**
